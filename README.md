## Concept

Imagine Explorers Club as the game [Destiny](https://www.google.com/search?q=destiny+2+map), but instead of planets, imagine islandsâ€”and each island is a different board, card, drawing, or other quick to learn game. Friends can browse and play games together in a party from their phones, laptops, and/or TVs via Chromecast.

## Development

Run the web app with `nx run web:serve`.
