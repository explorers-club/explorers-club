Welcome to your next adventure!

## What is Explorers Club?

Imagine something like Mario Party, but in a browser, set in an archipelagos in the Pacific ocean, with coconut-inspired characters. Players can play together straight from their phones and TVs, and join using a 4-digit code.

Other inspiration we are drawing from: [Rocket Crab](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab), Destiny, BoardGameArena, Tabletop Simulator, Jackbox.TV
